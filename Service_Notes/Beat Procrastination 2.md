## 🔍 Understand Why You're Procrastinating

Before jumping into strategies, reflect on the root cause. Ask yourself:

- **Fear of failure?** Afraid you won’t succeed, so you avoid trying.
- **Overwhelm?** The task feels too big or complicated.
- **Perfectionism?** You won’t start unless you can do it perfectly.
- **Boredom/lack of interest?** The task just doesn’t feel worth your energy.

Understanding the “why” helps you choose the right strategy.

## 🎯 Practical Tactics to Try

### ✅ 1. The 5-Minute Rule  
Commit to doing just 5 minutes of the task. Starting is the hardest part. Once you begin, momentum usually takes over.

---

### ✅ 2. Break It Down  
Turn big, vague tasks into small, concrete steps.  
Example:  
❌ _"Write report"_  
✅ _"Open doc → Write outline → Draft intro → Add section 1"_

---

### ✅ 3. Time Blocking  
Reserve blocks of time for focused work. Treat them like meetings.  
Bonus: Add buffer time between sessions to avoid burnout.

---

### ✅ 4. Pomodoro Technique  
- Work: 25 mins  
- Break: 5 mins  
- After 4 sessions, take a 15–30 min break  
This keeps your energy and focus sharp.

---

### ✅ 5. Remove Distractions  
- Silence phone or put it in another room  
- Use website blockers (e.g., Cold Turkey, Freedom)  
- Keep your workspace clean and minimal

---

### ✅ 6. Fake Deadlines  
Set deadlines earlier than needed.  
Tell someone what you’ll do and when — external accountability helps.

---

### ✅ 7. Reward Yourself  
Attach small rewards to completed tasks:  
☕ Coffee break  
🚶‍♂️ Quick walk  
📺 10 mins of a show  

---

### ✅ 8. Track Progress  
Use a simple tracker or journal. Seeing consistent effort builds confidence and momentum.
